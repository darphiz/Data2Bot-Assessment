# Solution 

- The solution to the problem lies in the solution folder
- Run `python main.py` to initiate the schema generator
- The algorithm I used is to crawl the entire JSON file by using the recursive strategy. This means once the code comes in contact with a list (object), it takes note of it and go ahead to crawl the object.
- Running test cases - `python test.py`

# Dependencies 
- The code is built using python core modules, therefore, there is no need to install any dependencies
- However, the code was built using the Python 3.9.12
